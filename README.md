# Motor Fault Diagnosis using Vibration data

- This repository is kind of test report about training pattern of vibration data.
- Now I focus on detecting fault based on Unsupervised learning.
- Now updating.

## Dataset

- Custom Vibration data
- 17.0khz sampling rate, collected for 40 minutes

## Models

- TadGAN(https://github.com/arunppsg/TadGAN)
- AnoGAN(https://github.com/yjucho1/anoGAN) -> **modified 2D to 1D**
- MAD-GAN(https://github.com/Guillem96/madgan-pytorch) -> **fix training bugs**

## Preprocessing
